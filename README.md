### 🎯 Overview
This is a small **Pygame experiment** I built during my first year of studies, inspired by those **satisfying physics videos** that often go viral on TikTok.  
The goal was simply to recreate that type of motion — a colorful ball bouncing smoothly inside a circle, leaving light trails behind.

It’s not meant to be a game, just a **creative test** to play with motion, color, and gravity.

---

### 🧠 What It Does
- Simulates a **bouncing ball** inside a circular arena  
- Uses smooth, frame-rate-independent physics  
- Creates **dynamic trails** and color changes on impact  
- Renders at 120 FPS for fluid motion  

---

### ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Library:** Pygame  
- **Concepts:** Simple physics simulation, color cycling, procedural motion

---

### 🪄 Context
I made this just for fun, to experiment with **visual coding** and **simulation aesthetics**.  
It’s a small personal project that helped me get more comfortable with Pygame and time-based animation.
